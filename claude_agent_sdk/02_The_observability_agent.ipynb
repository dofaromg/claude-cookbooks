        "Let's first give our agent the ability to understand and work with Git repositories. By adding the [Git MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/git) to our agent, it gains access to 13 Git-specific tools that let it examine commit history, check file changes, create branches, and even make commits. This transforms our agent from a passive observer into an active participant in your development workflow. In this example, we'll configure the agent to explore a repository's history using only Git tools. This is pretty simple, but knowing this, it is not difficult to imagine agents that can automatically create pull requests, analyze code evolution patterns, or help manage complex Git workflows across multiple repositories."

        "**From Notebook 00 (Research Agent)**:\n",
        "- Core SDK fundamentals with `query()` and `ClaudeSDKClient`\n",
        "- Basic tool usage with WebSearch and Read\n",
        "- Simple agent loops and conversation management\n",
        "\n",
        "**From Notebook 01 (Chief of Staff)**:\n",
        "- Multi-agent coordination through subagents\n",
        "- Governance through hooks and custom commands\n",
        "- Enterprise-ready agent architectures\n",
        "- Custom permissions and programmatic agents\n",
        "\n",
        "**From Notebook 02 (Advanced Topics)**:\n",
        "- **External Integration**: Git and GitHub MCP servers for system integration\n",
        "- **Custom Tools**: SDK MCP servers for in-process tool creation\n",
        "\n",
        "You now have the foundation to build production-ready agent systems that integrate with external tools, deploy reliably, handle real-world scale, and extend with reusable capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next Steps**:\n",
        "- Explore [Claude Agent SDK documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk)\n",
        "- Browse the [Plugin Hub](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus) (227+ plugins)\n",
        "- Create your own skills and share with the community\n",
        "- Deploy agents to production with confidence\n",
        "\n",
        "The complete agent implementations in `research_agent/`, `chief_of_staff_agent/`, and `observability_agent/` directories provide production-ready starting points for your projects."
